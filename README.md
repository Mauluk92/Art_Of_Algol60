# Art of Computer Programming: re-done in Algol60
This project stems from the reading of Donald Knuth book: The art of Computer programming.
I am trying to implement the algorithm and concepts showed in his book using Algol60.
I heard about this programming language in "Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid" by Douglas Hofstadter.
I fell in love with it and i decided to use it for didactic purposes, to dive deeply into the theory of algorithms.

Here's a list of algorithm implemented so far:

* [Euclid Algorithm](euclid_algorithm)

## How to install Algol60 on your computer? ##

There a variety of solutions, all available on [Algol60.org](http://www.algol60.org/3translators.htm).
I personally used the Python implementation, which can be readily be used modifying the file found in the zip algol60i/bin. Just append a .py file format to the file and run it with python, followed by the full path of the .a60 file.

Enjoy
